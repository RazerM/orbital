"""
A 800 kg spacecraft is orbiting the Earth on an elliptical orbit with a
semi-major axis of 46000 km and an eccentricity of 0.65, an inclination of 35
degrees, a right ascension of the ascending node of 80 degrees and an argument
of the pericentre of 0.

At 11 hours from the last passage at the pericentre the engine is misfired due
to a malfunction. The thrust has a modulus of 600 N. The telemetry onboard says
that the thrust has an out of plane component and an in plane component
directed against the velocity. The out of plane component is 30 % of the total
thrust. The engine is on for 5 minutes.

Assuming the total variation of velocity is instantaneous, compute the
difference between the nominal position and velocity of the spacecraft 4 hours
after the misfire and its actual position and velocity. Then compute the
difference in orbital parameters.
